		Subjects are typically interpreted literally from their pictogram.
		As a result, bigrams are the typical method of describing a subject in detail.
		Properties are intended to show information that cannot be derived from a bigram.
		Values are intended to clarify the nature of this information through written text.

			: - 'links' command/emoji to meaning, for on-the-fly conversation. E.g.
				1) 
			; - 'links' emojis/commands (e.g. {⤴️};{?😕} = "[in response to previous message] how come?")
	
	If no subject is given and a command {!} is not used, the implicit subject is the author of the message.
	
	Tense:
		➡️⌚: 	'Forward in time'/Future (explicit)
				(e.g. ➡️⌚(4pm[🎸]) = "[I will play guitar] at 4pm [next known "4pm"]."
		⬅️⌚:	'Backwards in time'/Past (explicit) 
				(e.g. ⬅️⌚(4pm[🎸]) = "[I played guitar] at 4pm [last known "4pm"]."
				
				"Last known/Next known" can be explicitly stated:
					(e.g. ⬅️⌚(4pm[🎸] 📅[25/12/2002]) = "[I played guitar] at 4pm on 25/12/2002.

		⌚: 	'Specific point in time (implict tense)'/Present (if no time given) 
				(e.g. ⌚(4pm[🎸]) = "[I am playing my guitar] at 4pm."
				(e.g. ⌚(🎸) = I am currently playing my guitar.
		
		If ⌚ is not associated with an action/event, the presumed time is 'now'.
		Statements without a ⌚ are considered 'timeless', in that their context is up to interpretation based on subject.
